\chapter{Simulating a Markov Modulated Fluid Model}
From a generator matrix, a fluid jump matrix and a vector of fluid rates, the lifetime of a Markov Modulated Fluid Model is simulated in Matlab.
For three different states with fluid rates $1$, $2$ and $3$ respectively and transition intensities given by generator matrix
\begin{equation}
G=\begin{bmatrix}
-3& 1& 2\\ 1& -2& 1\\ 0&1&-1
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}
A jump matrix with one jump is chosen
\begin{equation}
G=\begin{bmatrix}
0& 0& 5\\ 0& 0& 0\\ 0&0&0
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}
We've simulated some samples with and without jumps, this results in the following hazard rates:

As you can see, jumps increase the lifetime and make the hazard function less increasing.
