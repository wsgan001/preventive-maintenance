\begin{abstract}
	In this thesis, we model the breakdown of a machine as a Markov modulated fluid model (MMFM) and find a replacement policy minimizing the total discounted cost.
	At each transition of the MMFM's underlying Markov chain, the fluid level can instantaneously increase by a constant amount, where the amount depends on the origin and destination state of the Markov chain.
	Numeric methods to compute the total discounted cost for a given stationary replacement policy and iteration methods to find the optimal replacement policy are presented.
\end{abstract}

\chapter*{Executive summary?}
[Describe characteristics of a machine whose deterioration that can be modeled by a MMFM with jumps: different activities that in different degrees wear out the machine, the machine has no schedule (actions as CTMC), partial repairs between activities and an initial fitness of the machine.]

[List assumptions]

[The type of observations for which the policy is useful: trace data where at each time the current activity is known and failures are observed.]

[Mention the kind of historical data needed for the parameter estimation.]

[The type of (online) policy that is presented and how it would be implemented.]

[Explain possibilities of forecasting time until preventive repair.]

%\chapter{Analysis of problems}
\chapter{Age-based maintenance}\label{chapter:AgeBased}
A machine is considered that is subject to deterioration over time.
If no further observations are made while the machine is active, any choice to repair the machine can only be based on its age.
In this chapter we will investigate methods to find an optimal preventive maintenance policy in terms of total discounted cost.

\chapter{Simple fluid model with jumps}\label{chapter:SimpleFluid}
The problem of the previous chapter can be seen as a very simple Markov modulated fluid model:
Initially, the bucket has an amount of fluid $Q\sim F$.
The fluid decreases constantantly with rate $1$ and no fluid jumps occur.
In this chapter, we extend this model by allowing jumps to occur according to a Poisson process with rate $\lambda$.
The jumps all have the same constant (and known size) $J$.
In the real world, these fluid jumps could correspond to a partial repair of the machine.
The presence of jumps introduces the following complications:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The hazard of the machine failing at some time $t$ cannot be directly from the age only but also depends on the number of jumps that occurred before $t$.
	\item Furthermore, the times at which these jumps occurred also matter.
	When a jump occurs at time $t$, it is certain that the fluid quantity is at least $J$ so that you know for certain that in the interval $[t,t+J)$ the machine cannot fail.
\end{itemize}
In this chapter, the expected total discounted cost is calculated and methods are introduced to find the optimal replacement policy.

\chapter{Markov Modulated Fluid Model with jumps}
In this chapter, we extend the model of the simple fluid model with jumps from the previous chapter to a Markov modulated fluid model (MMFM) with various states, fluid rates, various fluid jump sizes and rates.
The fluid jumps occur when a transition occurs in the underlying Markov chain.
The MMFM that is used is similar to the first-order fluid model considered in \cite{Gribaudo2007}, with the addition of constant jumps.
The size of the jumps are constant.
The various fluid rates, transition rates and jump sizes introduce the following complications with regard to computing the total discounted cost and the optimal policy:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The computation of the expected discount factors $D(q)$ is more difficult as we need to take multiple
	paths with different probabilities and jump sizes into account.
	Moreover, it is also relevant from which state you start and where you end.
	\item There are different control limits $\mu_i$ for different states $s_i$, all depending on each other.
	\item A jump can cause the machine to be repaired when the amount of used fluid has exceeded the control limit.
\end{enumerate}
These complications will be explained and tackled in the following sections.
