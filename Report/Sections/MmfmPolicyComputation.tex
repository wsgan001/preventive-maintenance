\section{Computing the optimal control limits}
In this section, a numeric method will be introduced to compute control limits that satisfy \eqref{eq:MmfmHazardBounds}.
The expected total discounted cost will also be computed.
The method is similar to the successive approximation method that has been presented in section \ref{section:AgeBasedOptimalPolicyComputation} for the problem of age-based maintenance.

From \eqref{eq:MmfmHazardBoundsShort}, we know that if a policy $\hat\pi=[\hat\mu_1,...,\hat\mu_N]$ $\hat{\mu}$ satisfies
\[
h(\hat\mu_i)a+\sum\limits_j\Lambda^D_{ij}V(j,\mu_i^*,0,\pi^*)=0,\]
then $\hat{\pi}=\pi^*$.
The total discounted cost would then be given by \eqref{eq:MmfmTDC}.
This suggests the following iteration method:
At the $k+1$'th iteration, we will update the estimates of the optimal control limits $\mu_i^*$ by finding the $\hat{\pi}_i^{(k+1)}=[\hat{\mu}_i^{(k+1)},...,\hat{\mu}_i^{(k+1)}]$ that minimizes
\[
\begin{split}
\hat{V}^{(k+1)}=&\mathbb{E}[D_{i}(Q_0,\hat\pi^{(k+1)},0)](c+a+\hat{V}^{(k)})\\
&+\left[\int\limits_0^\infty \bar{F}(q)\Gamma_0(q,\hat\pi^{(k+1)},0)dq+\sum\limits_i\bar{F}(\hat\mu_i^{(k+1)})D_{i}(\hat\mu_i,\hat\pi^{(k+1)},0)\right](c+\hat{V}^{(k)}),
\end{split}
\]
where $\hat{V}^{(k)}$ is the current estimate of $V(0^+,\pi^*)$.
This could be found by looking for the control limits that satisfy
\begin{equation}
h(\hat\mu_i)a+\sum\limits_j\Lambda^D_{ij}\hat V(j,\mu_i^{(k)},0,\pi^{(k)})=0.
\end{equation}
For this iteration, we also need an initial value of the expected total discounted cost $\hat{V}^{(0)}$.
Although we do not have a proof for the convergence of this iteration method, for the problem parameters that were used, it did converge to solutions similar to those attained via value iteration.
