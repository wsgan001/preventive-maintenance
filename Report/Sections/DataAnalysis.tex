\chapter{Data analysis}\label{chapter:DataAnalysis}
In this chapter, the data from the Philips machine will be investigated.
First, the data will be described and visualized, then we will attempt to fit the lifetimes of the machine to various lifetime distributions.
\section{Data description}
The data from the Philips machine contains information about which operation the machine was performing at each time.
The data is anonimized so that for each operation, no name or description is given, but only an identifier.
\subsection{Data format}
Each run of the machine is represented by a trace.
A trace is a sequence of events.
These events are either the start or the end of an operation.
Each event has a timestamp and an integer representing the identifier of the operation.
The breakdown of the machine is represented by the end of a trace.
The lifetime of the machine is then the length of the time interval between the start of the first event and the end of the last event.

\subsection{Cleaning}
Before the data could be used, it first needed to be cleaned.
Because of the transitions between summer and winter time, a few events ended before they started.
We resolved this by simply ignoring the traces for which there was such an event.
Furthermore, there were also some other events with a time length of $-1$ seconds, these traces were also ignored.

\subsection{Visualization}
We will now visualize the distribution of the lengths of the runs of the machine.
In figure \ref{figure:distribution}, the empirical cumulative distribution function and the probability density function are plotted.
In these plots it is visible that the distribution has its mode around five days and has a part with a less steep downward slope around 6.5 days.
This part on the right hand side of the mode could be caused by intermediate repairs.

\end{figure}

For survival analysis, the hazard rate of the lifetime is important.
The observed hazard rate over time is plotted in figure \ref{figure:hazard}.
As you can see, the hazard rate is increasing for lifetimes shorter than 6.5 days.
For lifetimes larger than 6.5 days, the hazard rate seems to jump up and down a lot.
This is likely because these large lifetimes did not occur frequently enough in the dataset to smoothen out the hazard rate.
Hence, we can safely assume that the lifetime has an increasing hazard rate.

\section{Fitting lifetime distributions}
To be able to predict the remaining time until a failure, it is helpful to know how the lifetime of the machine is distributed.
In this section we will attempt to fit the lifetime to a distribution.

\cite{Lai2006} mentions a few common lifetime distributions.
We tried to fit these distributions over the observed lifetimes of the machine (using maximum likelihood estimation).
The Gamma distribution and the log-normal distribution fitted the data best, although still not very well.
The probability densities of these distributions are plotted over the density of the observed lifetimes in figure \ref{figure:fits}.
As you can see, these estimations are still not very accurate as they do not include the blob on the right side of the mode.

\begin{figure}[H]\label{figure:fits}
	\centering
	\setlength\fwidth{0.7\textwidth}
	\input{Plots/lifetimesFits.tex}
	\caption{The probability densities over the density of the observed lifetimes.}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Phase-type}
As the class of Phase-Type distributions is dense in the space of positive continuous distributions \cite{Ocinneide1999}, a Phase-Type distribution could also be used to model the lifetimes.
However, Phase-Type distributions have a few disadvantages:
The number of parameters grows quadratically with the amount of states and most of these parameters are redundant.
Furthermore, convergence of the EM-algorithm (to estimate the parameters) is slow and can get stuck in saddle points and local maxima \cite{Asmussen1996}.
Because of this, we will not use a Phase-type distribution to model the lifetime of the machine.

\section{Transition times}
In order to model the transitions between the events as a Markov chain, we need to find out whether the transition times (i.e. the length of the time intervals between the start and end of an event) are exponentially distributed.
When we visualized the distribution of the transition times for each of the states, we noticed two things:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The distribution is not exponentially distributed.
	In figure \ref{figure:transitionFit}, it is visible that the exponential distribution fits the data poorly.
	\item For some events, the distribution of the time length seems to be multimodal.
	In figure \ref{figure:transitionBimodal}, an example of an event whose time length seems to have multimodal distribution.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{figure}[H]\label{figure:transitionFit}
\centering
\setlength\fwidth{0.5\textwidth}
\input{Plots/transitionTimesFit.tex}
\caption{An exponential distribution fitted over the distribution of the time length of a certain event.}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[H]\label{figure:transitionBimodal}
\centering
\setlength\fwidth{0.5\textwidth}
\input{Plots/transitionTimesBimodal.tex}
\caption{The estimated probability density function for the time length of a certain event.}
\end{figure}
From this, we can safely conclude that the transition times are not exponential and that a CTMC is not appropriate to accurately model the trace data.
But since using a semi-Markov model would complicate the analysis significantly, we will approximate the data by a CTMC anyway.
